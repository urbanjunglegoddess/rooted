        - Select your button or input field.
        - Use **Inner Shadow** to create a "pressed" effect: **X: 10, Y: 10, Blur: 20px**, color: **Ebony (#666754)** at 25%
          opacity.
        - Add **Drop Shadow**: **X: -10, Y: -10, Blur: 20px**, color: **Cultured (#F7F7F9)** at 25% opacity.
        - The combination of inner and outer shadows creates a **neomorphic** 3D effect, where elements appear embedded or
          raised.

### ** Glassmorphism with 3D Layers**

    - **Create 3D Glass Panels**:
        - Apply a **Frosted Glass Effect** by adding **Background Blur**: Select your modal or card > **Effects** > *
          *Background Blur** (set blur between 20–30px).
        - Use a **transparent fill** (e.g., **#FFFFFF at 10% opacity**).
        - Add subtle **Drop Shadows** with a high blur to make the glass-like element appear raised or floating.

### ** Typography with 3D Effects**

    - **3D Text Shadows**:
        - Select your text layer.
        - Apply multiple **Drop Shadows** with slight offsets to simulate light source direction.
        - For a **raised effect**, use:
            - Shadow 1: **X: 2, Y: 2, Blur: 4px**, color: **Flame (#D2622A)** at 50% opacity.
            - Shadow 2: **X: -2, Y: -2, Blur: 6px**, color: **Gold (#D4AF37)** at 50% opacity.

### **3D Icon Design**

## ** 3D Design Concept**

### **Visual Style**:

    - **Theme**: Afrofuturism in **3D**
        - Elevate the **futuristic Afro-centric elements** by introducing **3D geometric shapes**, **holographic textures**,
          and **glass-like components** that pop out visually.
        - Use **layering and shadows** to give depth and make components feel more interactive and immersive.
        - **Textures**: Introduce subtle **3D textures** (like organic, tribal patterns) embossed on cards and buttons to
          give them a tactile, futuristic feel.

---

# ** 3D Effects Across UI Components**

### **Holographic Effects**:

#### **3D Holographic Buttons**:
    - Create buttons that appear as **floating holographic panels**. The button itself can have a **slight glow**, and
      when pressed, it will **sink slightly**, adding to the 3D effect.
      - Add **animated iridescent gradients** on hover or tap, giving the button a futuristic, ethereal glow that mimics
        holographic tech.
      - Use colors like **Flame (#D2622A)** and **Gold Metallic (#D4AF37)** for holographic lights and reflections.

    - Use **3D Afro-centric icons** with a metallic sheen, making them look like they're popping out of the screen.
      Icons can have reflective surfaces, shifting slightly based on user interaction or the device's movement (
      utilizing **gyroscope** or **parallax effects**).

### **Neomorphism with 3D Depth**:

#### **3D Neomorphic Buttons & Inputs**:

    - Add more **depth and shadow** to existing **neomorphic components** (buttons, cards, inputs), so they look like
      they’re floating or pressed into the surface.
      - Use **deep shadows** and **soft edges** to create buttons that appear pillowed or extruded.
      - For interactive elements like inputs, use **3D shadows** that grow or shrink as the user taps or interacts with
            them, creating the sense of pressure.
    - **Text Inputs**:
        - Create **3D text fields** that appear engraved or raised from the surface. When active, the input field should
          have a **soft glowing outline** and **inner shadow** to emphasize the depth.

### **Glassmorphism with 3D Layers**:

#### **3D Glass Panels for Modals and Pop-Ups**:

    - Implement **glass-like 3D layers** for modals and pop-ups. These components can have a **frosted glass texture**,
      with a **3D effect** that makes them look as though they are hovering above the rest of the UI.
      - When interacted with, these elements should have **light reflections** and **blurs** that shift subtly, mimicking
        real glass behavior.

      - **Cards**:
          - Use **glass-like 3D cards** with frosted edges and soft reflections. These cards can be layered to create a sense
            of depth, and hovering over them can create slight **rotational 3D animations**.

      - **Buttons and Icons**:
          - Add **transparent, glass-like buttons and icons** with glowing neon outlines. Use 3D layering, where the text
            inside the button appears behind a thin, glass panel.

### **3D Typography**:

    - **Titles and Headers**:
        - Implement **3D text effects** for headers, where the text looks carved out of the surface or raised above it. Add
          **subtle reflections** and shadows that react to the user’s scroll or movement.
        - Use **Aqala Display** with a 3D shadow that shifts dynamically when the user tilts or moves the phone (using *
          *device gyroscope**).
    
      - **Interactive Text**:
          - Buttons, links, and other interactive text elements should use **hover states** that incorporate slight **3D
            extrusion** or **pushed-down effects**. Text can appear as though it’s floating, with shadows beneath to make it
            stand out.

### **3D Shadows and Lighting**:

    - **Dynamic Shadows**:
        - All components, from cards to buttons to modals, should have **3D dynamic shadows**. These shadows will vary in
          depth based on user interaction and **device tilt**, providing a sense of realism.
        - Use **realistic soft shadows** under 3D elements like cards, buttons, and inputs to make them appear as if they’re
          physically raised from the surface.
    
      - **Light Reflections**:
              - Use **light sources** from the top of the interface to create **realistic reflections** and highlights. Components
                like icons, cards, and modals can have **light streaks** or subtle glowing effects that react to movement,
                mimicking real-world lighting.

### **3D Animations and Transitions**:

    - **3D Card Flipping & Rotation**:
        - For cards (e.g., **Art Pieces in Afro Art Collective**, or **Project Status Cards in PhantomRail**), implement *
          *3D flip animations**. When a card is tapped, it can rotate on its axis to reveal more information on the back.
        - Create **subtle rotation effects** based on user interaction, where cards or images tilt slightly in response to
          touch.

### **3D Parallax Scrolling**:

            - Add **parallax effects** to backgrounds and cards, making components shift in layers as the user scrolls. This
            creates a sense of depth where different layers move at varying speeds.
              - Implement **gyroscopic animations**, where the UI slightly shifts as the phone tilts, giving the illusion of depth
              and perspective.
              - **Interactive Floating Elements**:
              - Elements like **floating buttons**, **notifications**, and **action items** can hover above the UI with **subtle
              3D movement**. As the user interacts, these elements can react with **small, floating animations**.

          culturally rooted. Patterns that look like **engraved wood** or **metal** can give a physical presence to these
          elements, making them feel real and touchable.

### **3D Glass and Metallic Textures**:

    - **Glassmorphic** elements like **modals, cards, and buttons** can have **3D glass textures**, appearing as though they
      are floating glass panels with light reflections and refractions.
      - For interactive elements, use **metallic textures** that react to touch and interaction. For example, **Gold
        Metallic (#D4AF37)** can be used in buttons that shine with **realistic light reflections**.

---

# ** 3D Modal and Pop-ups**

    - **3D Pop-Ups**:
        - Pop-ups can have a **floating 3D appearance**, with depth added via layered shadowing and **glassmorphic effects
          **. When dismissed, the pop-up can **fade out** with a **3D collapse animation**.
    
      - **Modal Windows**:
          - Modals should appear as **floating panels**, hovering above the screen. Add **frosted glass textures** with a 3D
            curvature, making them feel like a solid, touchable object. Use **3D depth shadows** beneath them to enhance the
            floating effect.
    
      - **3D Confirmation/Action Modals**:
          - These should have a **glasslike appearance** with **holographic buttons** at the bottom for user actions like
            “Submit” or “Cancel”. The buttons should react with **light pulses** when hovered or tapped, and the entire modal
            should slightly rotate on interaction.

---

# **3D Iconography and Illustrations**
